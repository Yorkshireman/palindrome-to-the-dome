# Palindrome to the Dome


In this directory there is a file named "textfile.md". It contains several hundred lines of text.

As a team, you must parse the content of that file and write a Ruby method that checks each line to determine if it is palindromic.

Non-alphanumeric characters such as punctuation and quotation marks should not be taken into account, nor should the method check for case-sensitivity.

Lines that contain no alphanumeric characters should not be counted towards the total.

For example:

"Madam, I'm Adam" is a palindrome.

BONUS: Write a recursive method to check for palindromes!
